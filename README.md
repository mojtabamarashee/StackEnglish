If you need the keys **_to be_** numbers, a simple map call **_will suffice_**<br>
Function to execute on each element in the array, **_taking_** four arguments<br>
Currying helps you to avoid **_passing_** the same variable again and again<br>
If you say that something will suffice, you mean it will be **_enough to achieve a purpose_** or to **_fulfil a need_**. A cover letter should never exceed one page; often a far shorter letter will suffice<br>
